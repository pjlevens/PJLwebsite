<h1>Peter J. Levens</h1>
<p>PhD student</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Glasgow, funded by an STFC Research Studentship. Been doing this for the last 3 years or so, and will be finishing up scarily soon. (help)</p>
<p>My work during this PhD has been focussed on solar astronomy, specifically solar tornadoes and solar prominences. I mostly use spectroscopic techniques to study ultraviolet/extreme-ultraviolet observations of these structures, however recently I've been using radiative transfer codes to model certain parameters of prominences.</p>
<p>I also spent four months of my PhD in Paris working at the Observatoire de Paris in Meudon. During that time I worked on analysing IRIS observations of tornado-like prominences.</p>
