<h1>Peter J. Levens</h1>
<p>Former PhD student</p>
<hr />
<p>I've just finished my <a href="https://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/?p=2403">PhD at the University of Glasgow</a>, funded by an STFC Research Studentship. Took me 4 whole years but I only went and did it.</p>
<p>You can check out my thesis, <i>Diagnostics of Solar Tornado-like Prominences</i>, <a href="http://theses.gla.ac.uk/8684/">here</a>.</p>
<p>My work during the PhD was focussed on solar astronomy, specifically solar prominences. I mostly used spectroscopic techniques to study ultraviolet/extreme-ultraviolet observations of these structures, as well as using radiative transfer codes to model certain parameters of prominences.</p>
<p>I spent four months of my PhD in Paris working at the Observatoire de Paris in Meudon. During that time I worked on analysing IRIS observations of tornado-like prominences. The great thing about doing a PhD is getting to travel all over the place. It's pretty awesome.</p>
  <p>I've also had a fair amount of experience in making observations using both satellites and ground-based telescopes.</p>
  <p>I am on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Levens">ResearchGate</a>.</p>
