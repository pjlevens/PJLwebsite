<h1>Peter J. Levens</h1>
<p>PhD student</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm currently a <a href="https://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/?p=2403">PhD student at the University of Glasgow</a>, funded by an STFC Research Studentship. Been doing this for the last 3 years or so, and I'm curreNTLY WRITING A THESIS OH SWEET JE$%Â£"!!. (help)</p>
<p>My work during this PhD has been focussed on solar astronomy, specifically solar prominences. I mostly use spectroscopic techniques to study ultraviolet/extreme-ultraviolet observations of these structures, however recently I've been using radiative transfer codes to model certain parameters of prominences.</p>
<p>I spent four months of my PhD in Paris working at the Observatoire de Paris in Meudon. During that time I worked on analysing IRIS observations of tornado-like prominences. The great thing about doing a PhD is getting to travel all over the place. It's pretty awesome.</p>
  <p>I've also had a fair amount of experience in making observations using both satellites and ground-based telescopes.</p>
