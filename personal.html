<h1>Peter J. Levens</h1>
<p>Human</p>
<hr />
<p>When I'm not sitting in the office doing the science, or somewhere else at a conference or something, I can normally be found doing one of the following:</p>

  <p>~ Music ~</p>
  <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/pjlevens">I occasionally upload things I've recorded here</a>. Though not very often.
  <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThisHandsomeJam/">Hindsight (formerly This Handsome Jam)</a>. We're a rock and roll band. I play bass and attempt to do vocal harmonies. We're on hiatus at the moment, but we are working on an EP that should be done soonish. <a href="https://twitter.com/BandHindsight?lang=en">We also have Twitter.</a>
  
  <p>~ Drawing ~</p>
  <p>I also draw.</p>
  <p>Though I, uh, don't have anything to show you right now...</p>
  
  <p>~ Reading ~</p>
  <p>Ah yes, I like to read. At the moment I'm reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60963338-peter-j?shelf=currently-reading">this book</a></p>

  <p>~ Eating ~</p>
  <p>Food is good</p>
  
  <p>~ THE INTERNET ~</p>
  <p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/PJLevens">tweet</a> sometimes</p>
  <p>You can also email me at peterlevens(at)gmail.com</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>And if I'm not doing any of that I'm probably out and about in my van camping or driving or broken down at the side of a road somewhere.</p>
