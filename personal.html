<h1>Peter J. Levens</h1>
<p>Human</p>
<hr />
<p>When I'm not sitting in the office doing the science I can normally be found doing one of the following:</p>

  <h2>~ Music ~</h2>
  <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/pjlevens">I occasionally upload things I've recorded here</a>. Though not very often.
  <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThisHandsomeJam/">Hindsight (formerly This Handsome Jam)</a>. We're a rock and roll band. I play bass and attempt to do vocal harmonies. We're on hiatus at the moment, but we are working on an EP that should be done soonish. <a href="https://twitter.com/BandHindsight?lang=en">We also have Twitter</a>.
  
  <h2>~ Drawing ~</h2>
  <p>I draw. Have a look at my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pjlevens/">Instagram</a> for drawings and more.</p>
  <p>I am also part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/PhysartCollect">Physart Collective</a>. We are a bunch of physicists who like to draw famous people on the whiteboards in our office then post them to Twitter. Take a look!</p>
  
  <h2>~ Reading ~</h2>
  <p>Ah yes, I like to read. At the moment I'm reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60963338-peter-j?shelf=currently-reading">this book</a>.</p>

  <h2>~ Eating ~</h2>
  <p>Food is good.</p>
  
  <h2>~ THE INTERNET ~</h2>
  <p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/PJLevens">tweet</a> sometimes.</p>
  <p>You can also email me at peterlevens(at)gmail.com</p>

  <h2>~ Other? ~</h2>
  <p>And if I'm not doing any of that I'm probably out and about in my van camping or driving or broken down at the side of a road somewhere.</p>
