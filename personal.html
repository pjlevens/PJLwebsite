<h1>Dr. Peter J. Levens</h1>
<p>Human</p>
<hr />
<p>When I'm not doing some sort of science I can normally be found doing one of the following:</p>

  <h2>~ Music ~</h2>
  <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/pjlevens">I occasionally upload things I've recorded here</a>. Though not very often.</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BandHindsight/">Hindsight</a> (formerly This Handsome Jam). We're a rock and roll band. I play bass and attempt to do vocal harmonies. We're on a bit of a hiatus at the moment, but we <a href="https://hindsight.bandcamp.com/">RELEASED AN EP</a>!! You can download it for free, but any proceeds will go to the charity <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/">MIND</a> who do great work with mental health. <a href="https://twitter.com/BandHindsight?lang=en">We also have Twitter</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="http://solcosmos.bandcamp.com/">My Bandcamp page.</a> (at the moment will just lead to the following:)</p>
  <p><a href="http://solcosmos.bandcamp.com/album/k-o-nec">This is some weird music I made a while ago.</a> Inspired by the eerie recordings of the Conet Project and the numbers stations that were used during the Cold War to send secret, encoded messages to spies. I always meant to do more with this idea, but never got round to it.</p>
  
  <h2>~ Drawing ~</h2>
  <p>I draw sometimes. Have a look at my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pjlevens/">Instagram</a> for drawings and more.</p>
  <p>I am part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/PhysartCollect">Physart Collective</a>. We are a bunch of physicists who like to draw famous people on the whiteboards in our office then post them to Twitter. We also have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/physartcollect/">Instagram</a> page. Take a look!</p>
  
  <h2>~ Reading ~</h2>
  <p>Ah yes, I like to read. At the moment I'm reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60963338-peter-j?shelf=currently-reading">this book</a>.</p>

  <h2>~ Eating ~</h2>
  <p>Food is good.</p>
  
  <h2>~ THE INTERNET ~</h2>
  <p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/PJLevens">tweet</a> sometimes.</p>
  <p>You can also email me at peterlevens(at)gmail.com</p>

  <h2>~ Other ~</h2>
  <p>And if I'm not doing any of that I'm probably out and about in my van camping or driving or broken down at the side of a road somewhere. Or playing D&D. You know, standard nerd stuff.</p>
